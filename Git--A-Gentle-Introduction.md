# **The Heck Is That? :thinking:**

# It's a version control system!

* **The heck is that now!**
* <span style="color:#80d9f3">Put simply: *It's a time-machine for your code!*</span>
* **Okay now give me a real answer!**
* <span style="color:#80d9f3">Hmmmmmm........</span>

# Okay here's the real answer
![bg left:40% 80%](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/gitresources/git-branches-merge.png)

* *Git is a <span style="color:yellow">distributed</span> <span style="color:orange">version control system</span>*
> <span style="color:yellow">Distributed</span> $\Rightarrow$ Everyone has a full copy of the repo
> <span style="color:orange">Version control system</span> $\Rightarrow$ Keeps track of changes in code

# <!--fit--> Why should I care?

---
# (Part 1: I wanna go back in time)

* Damn I think I broke something by adding some code...
  * **No problem!** Just `revert` back to the last working version
  
* `git revert HEAD` $\Rightarrow$ Revert to the last commit
* `git revert HEAD~2` $\Rightarrow$ Revert two commits back
* `git diff HEAD HEAD~2` $\Rightarrow$ See the changes between the last two commits

---

# (Part 2: I wanna try something new)

* I want to experiment with some new features but don't want to mess up the main code...
  * **No problem!** Just create a new `branch` and work on that

* `git branch feat-new` $\Rightarrow$ Create a new branch called `feat-new`
* `git checkout feat-new` $\Rightarrow$ Switch to the `feat-new` branch
* `git checkout main` $\Rightarrow$ Switch back to the main branch
* `git merge feat-new` $\Rightarrow$ Merge `feat-new` branch into `main`


---
# (Part 3, 4, 5 ... and so on)

* I see this cool project, but I want to some changes of my own...
  * Just `fork` the repo and make your changes
* I want to let my friends work on my project...
  * Just `clone` the repo and work on it
* I want to sync my project with the latest changes...
  * Just `pull` and `push` your changes to the repo *...and so on*

> *The possibilities, despite being endless, are quite simply, beyond the scope of this simple tutorial ðŸ˜ž*

# <!--fit--> How do I get started?

> RTFM!
>> *Read the "friendly" manual of course :wink: [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)*

# Aha! Now that you're interested...

- **Step 1:** Install Git, duh! ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **Step 2:** Set up your Git with your credentials on `git bash` and run the following commands:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.name@email.com
```
> **Note:** The above step must mandatorily be done from the terminal ðŸ˜±, but fortunately only once!

- **Step 3:** Create a new repository on GitHub
- **Step 4:** Clone the repository to your local machine

```shell
git clone https://your-repo-url
```

# <!--fit--> "I ain't using no terminal!"

> **No problem!** There are plenty of GUI clients or IDEs that support Git, VSCode being one of them!
>> But the terminal is where the real magic happens! :sparkles:
